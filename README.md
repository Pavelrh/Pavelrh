Hey there! I'm Shridhara Pavel, a tech enthusiast working mostly on research papers and startups. Over the past couple of years, I've been freelancing, creating games, leading/building startups, developing websites and training machine learning/transformer models. I run three cool startups under my holding company 41 Inc.:

1. Kozot: Crafting smart devices and robotics for smart cities.
2. Locallu: Building the world's first multi-LLM interaction x human engine for a groundbreaking approach to AGI.
3. LegalDad: Making legal document prep super easy for everyone.

I'm also doing some AI research with a computer science professor on Self-Observing agents & Real-Time Decision Making Engines & writing a research paper on it, though I can't spill all the details just yet.
I aim to revolutionize big tech & the world with my expertise. Let's connect and create something awesome together!.
